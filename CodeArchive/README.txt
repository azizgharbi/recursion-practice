This source code archive contains some examples of recursive programs written in C, C# and Ruby. The C and C# programs are provided as Visual Studio solutions which may be loaded and run into Microsoft Visual Studio. The Ruby programs may be loaded into any Ruby editor or run from the command prompt using a Ruby interpreter.

PLEASE NOTE: YOU DO NOT NEED TO BE A RUBY, C OR C# PROGRAMMER TO FOLLOW THIS COURSE. THE CODE IS INTENDED TO SHOW EXAMPLES OF RECURSION. THESE SAMPLES CAN BE USED AS ‘PSEUDO-CODE’ SO THAT YOU MAY TRANSLATE THE CODE INTO WHICHEVER LANGUAGE YOU WISH TO USE.

Recursive techniques apply to all mainstream languages. You may want to try ‘translating’ this sample code into some other language. The samples are all quite short and simple. You can use the same techniques in Java, JavaScript, C++, Python, Basic, Pascal and many other languages.
